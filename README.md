# Travel Game!
## This is a game I made that is to teach college students how valuable time and money are with limited resources, and to choose wisely when it comes to commuting from Point A to Point B.

### The user is given three choices of transportation: bus, taxi, and walking. They are given a certain amount of time, money, and distance to their destination. The game gives the user a scenario, and they are to use any of the three modes of transportation, as long as they reach Point B under the alotted time.
___
### The user writes their name and it is then stored in the local database (I connected it to MySQL Workbench however have not included it amongst the source code).
### There is a scenario file which gives out different scenarios, as well as gives the user a scenario after each mode of transportation they chose which then subtracts time, money, and distance until they either reached the destination, or they run out of time. 

#### This was made in Java with the Eclipse IDE. Got very familiar with the swing and Abstract Window Toolkit (awt) libraries. Feel free to check out the source code!
